# Just Another Pokédex ![Pokéball](./public/favicon.ico)

My attempt at learning **ReactJS** by building a **Pokédex**

To-Do :-

- [x] Build a basic react app
- [x] Build a Card Component for basic data
- [x] Add Flip animation on click to reveal the other side of the card ([Flippy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-flippy))
- [x] Use [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch data and build cards accordingly
- [x] Create a Grid of Pokémon Cards ([Semantic-UI-React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/collections/grid/))
- [x] Sequentially fetch data so that cards load one by one rather than all at once
- [x] Add Infinite Scroll so that new data is fetched when scrolled down (Needs to be refined)
- [x] Shift to cached API of PokéApi
- [ ] Add a Title Bar
- [ ] Add a Github link to this repository on the title bar
- [ ] Open a side information panel when clicked on 'More Details' about the Pokémon

\* Still thinking about new features
